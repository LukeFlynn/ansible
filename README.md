# deeeeeeee finest playbooks eva made (not really)
---

Ansible playbook(s) for my private infrastructure @ OVH. These are all based around CentOS 7, as that is my *server* distro of choice these days. Woo, RedHat.

I don't have plans to maintain this for anyone's use other than my own! Use at your own risk! That said, feel free to contribute!

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --ask-pass
```
